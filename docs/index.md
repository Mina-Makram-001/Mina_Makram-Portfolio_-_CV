# KNIME Pipeline

Welcome to the documentation hub for the **company** KNIME data pipeline.
Everything here — workflows, screenshots, graphs, notebooks, and reference
material — is kept in one place and cross-linked so it can be maintained from a
single source (see [How-to → Add a new workflow](how-to/add-a-new-workflow.md)).
